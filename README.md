## 🧠 Architecture Overview

This project follows a layered architecture similar to **MVC (Model–View–Controller)**:

- **Models** → Data structure and core entities  
- **UI** → User interaction layer  
- **Services** → Business logic  
- **Database** → Data persistence  

---

## ▶️ Entry Point

### `main.py`

The main entry point of the application.  
It initializes the system, connects UI components with services, and starts the program execution.

---

## 🎨 UI Layer (`ui/`)

This directory contains user interface modules responsible for interacting with users.

| File | Description |
|----|------------|
| Student_ui.py | Student management interface |
| SchoolEmployee_ui.py | School employee management |
| ClassRoom_ui.py | Classroom management |
| Subject_ui.py | Subject management |
| member_ui.py | Library member management |
| lib_item_ui.py | Library items management |

---

## 🧱 Models Layer (`models/`)

This directory contains core domain models implemented using OOP concepts.

| File | Description |
|----|------------|
| Person.py | Base class for people |
| Student.py | Student entity |
| SchoolEmployee.py | Employee entity |
| ClassRoom.py | Classroom entity |
| Subject.py | Subject entity |
| member.py | Library member |
| lib_item.py | Library item |

Each model encapsulates its own attributes and behaviors.

---

## ⚙️ Services Layer (`services/`)

Contains business logic and application rules.

| File | Description |
|----|------------|
| School_Service.py | School-related operations |
| Library_Service.py | Library-related operations |

Services act as a bridge between UI and database layers.

---

## 🗄️ Database Layer (`database/`)

Responsible for data persistence using SQLite.

| File | Description |
|----|------------|
| db.py | Database connection and queries |
| school.db | SQLite database file |

---

## 📝 Logging (`log/`)

- School_Manager_System_log.txt  
Used to record system activities, events, and errors for debugging and monitoring.

---

## 🖼️ Assets (`images/`)

Contains graphical assets used in the UI.

---

## 🧪 Virtual Environment (`venv312/`)

A Python virtual environment used to manage project dependencies.

---

## 📦 Requirements

All required dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

Example:
```txt
sqlite3
tkinter
```

Add any additional libraries here if the project grows.
